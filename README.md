# Binary Search Tree
Implemented Binary Search Tree Application that allows fast search, insert, and deletion of sorted data. It also allows displaying data in PreOrder, InOrder, and PostOrder styles. All with the best complexities.

## Description
An application of object-oriented programming & Data structures concepts using C++ in a binary search tree. Binary Search Tree is a node-based binary tree data structure that stores data according to the following rules: the left subtree contains only nodes with keys lesser than the node's key, while the opposite in the right subtree which has only nodes with keys more than the node's key. So, following these rules, the application allows the user to:
1. Insert new Items.
   > The user can _**insert**_ data randomly into the tree, and it'll be automatically sorted according to binary search tree properties.
2. Delete new Items.
   > The user can **_delete_** whatever element he wants, and the tree will automatically re-arrange the elements according to the remaining ones.
3. Search for a specific item.
   > The user can **_search_** for a specific item in the tree, and the application will respond whether the element is present or not. Taking advantage of the binary search tree properties, the search process finds the shortest way to find the element by comparing the nodes with each other. 
4. Find the Maximum node value.
   > The user can **_search_** for the maximum node value.
5. Display items in any of the following styles: InOrder, PreOrder, PostOrder.
   > The user can **_choose_** the desired style to view the elements of the tree.
6. End the program.
   > If the user chooses 8, the program _**terminates**_.

All of the processes are designed to run at the least time complexity. This project covers multiple concepts such as object-oriented programming, Data Structures, Time and space complexities, handling invalid input and other types of errors, and case statements in an advanced way. 

## Executing program
Run the program, choose your desired process, and have fun ^^.
